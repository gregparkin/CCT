<p>Login to CCT to get more information about the work. Always check the Approve queue for work needing your
authorization. Use the Search feature to find things. Look at the Help and Index if you don't know how to
do something.</p>
<p>You are responsible to keep your group's contact information updated and correct in CSC, NET and CCT.</p>
<p>Notifications go out to all members of your NET group or CCT subscriber list team. This means
that someone from your group may have already approved the work. Your Approve queue may be empty!</p>
<p>If you see green text next to the server below in parentheses, this information will contain
your groups current status response, the persons name, and the date of the response.</p>
<p>Some of these work requests are for FYI notification only, which means you are not required 
to approve the work, but your group wants to be informed of any pending work.
    <i>(See the Response Required field in the ticket below.)</i></p>
<p>As status information changes for work, you will get updates. This doesn't mean you have to do
anything. New status messages in the past 30 hours under the server names below are colored in blue
and are meant to keep you informed of changes. Read the log.</p>

<p>If you discover an error or problem, please send screenshots and detail information about it
to Greg Parkin (gregparkin58@gmail.com). In most cases he needs to try and recreate the error
in order to fix the problem.</p>
<p>CCT 7 is a new full major release and is best viewed using Firefox or Chrome. There are always
new feature requests and enhancements to make it better. Please be patient, your input is always
welcome.</p>

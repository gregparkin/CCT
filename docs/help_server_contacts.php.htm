<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    This tool replaces the original CCT 6 Trace Data Sources tool. It outputs information slightly
    different because of the new way CCT 7 gathers contact information.
</p>

<h3>Server Contacts</h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    Use this tool to determine who will receive notifications from CCT and whether they will be
    an Approver or just want to receive FYI notications. CCT gathers contact information from
    three places only; CSC, NET and CCT. CSC contains contact records or CSC banners as we call
    them. These contact records contain NET group pin numbers from the NET tool. <i>(A list of CSC
    banners used by CCT are listed below.)</i> If users don't use CSC or NET but want to receive
    notifications or be in the work approval process, they will setup CCT Subscriber Lists.

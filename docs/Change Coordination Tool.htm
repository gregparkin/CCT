    <p><b><u>All Tickets</u></b></p>
    <p>
        The "Open" icon on the tool bar contains two options for viewing CCT tickets. You can open either all tickets
        created by everyone or you can open tickets by the Net-Pin tool groups you belong too. The only difference in the
        two options is a filter setting that shows the user what they want to see.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Main Grid</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        The following is a grid containing all the tickets found in CCT.
        <img src="Change%20Coordination%20Tool_files/toolbar_open1.png">
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Paging Through the Grid</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        <img src="Change%20Coordination%20Tool_files/toolbar_open2.png" align="top"><br>
        You page through the grid by clicking on the arrow icons at the bottom (center) of the grid. The first icon starting
        at the left (bar - left arrow, left arrow) will page back to the top of the grid. The second icon (left arrow,
        left arrow) takes you back one page. The third icon (right arrow, right arrow) takes you one page forward. And the
        last icon (right arrow, right arrow, bar) takes you to the last page in the grid.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Useful Grid Icons</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        <img src="Change%20Coordination%20Tool_files/toolbar_open6.png" align="bottom"><br>
        These icons on the far bottom left of the grid can be used to <b><u>Search</u></b>, <b><u>Export to Excel</u></b>,
        <b><u>Refresh</u></b> the grid, and <b><u>Sort Order</u></b> where you choose how you want the grid sorted.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Search</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        <img src="Change%20Coordination%20Tool_files/search1.png" align="bottom">
        This is what the search window looks like when you click on the magnifying glass. Once you setup your search
        criteria you would click on the Find button. You can search on multiple columns to drill down to what you want.
        When you close the search menu you can page up and down through your search results. To reset the search
        options, click on the magnifying glass icon again and click on the Reset button. You will now see all the
        default tickets again.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Export to Excel</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        <img src="Change%20Coordination%20Tool_files/excel.png"><br>
        When you click on the suitcase icon, the entire grid will be downloaded to your PC in cvs format which is
        compatible with Excel and LibreOffice Calc. Just remember it is the whole grid and not just the data you are
        viewing in the current grid page.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Sort Order</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        <img src="Change%20Coordination%20Tool_files/help_toolbar_open_sort.png"><br>
        Clicking on the star icon will bring up this dialog box where you can choose what columns you would
        like the grid sorted by. You can also choose the column sort order and direction (ascending or descending).
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Sub-Grids</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        In the far left column of the grid you will notice a <img src="Change%20Coordination%20Tool_files/toolbar_open3.png" align="top"><br><br>
        <img src="Change%20Coordination%20Tool_files/toolbar_open4.png"><br>
        This opens up a sub-grid under the record showing the servers associated with the ticket. When that sub-grid opens
        with the servers you will see another + sign that you can click on. When you click that icon a list of all the
        contacts will be displayed. Lastly, the contacts sub-grid will have a plus sign that will show you how this group
        of people are connected to the server being worked on. <br><br>
        For example the actual work may be on a physical server that houses a bunch of VMWARE servers. So this last grid
        will show the contacts how they are connected to the physical server where they have no responsibility for, but
        where they need to be notified of pending work which may effect their application server.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Ticket Dialog Box - General (tab)</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">

        If you want to see more information about a ticket or perform some kind of action on it, click on on the row where
        the ticket is located. A dialog box will appear giving you a list of options you can perform. If you are not the
        CCT owner or CCT admin you will not be able to cancel or update the ticket. But you can look at detail information
        about the work request, log messages and send email out.

        Remedy tickets are no longer required in order for CCT to work. However, there is a place in the CCT ticket where
        you can enter a Remedy ticket that references this CCT ticket. There is also a View button that you click on that
        can retrieve the Remedy ticket directly from the Remedy CM database. Be patience here, because it can sometimes
        take time to retrieve and display the ticket here.
    </p>

        information into your CCT ticket. This button is for your convenience when you want the text in your
        CCT ticket to match what is in the Remedy ticket and you don't want to copy and paste or retype everything.
        <br><br>
        Before it overwrites any text that might be in your CCT ticket, you will be prompted with a message asking
        for your intentions before proceeding with the operation.

        owner and there are servers in this ticket that you do not support, then it would be better if you use the sendmail
        function that is available in the Server Dialog box. (See below for details.)<br><br>

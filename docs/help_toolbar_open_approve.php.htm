<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    This screen is used to view and approve work requests for your net-group or subscriber group. It works just like
    the Open tickets screen from the toolbar menu. The only difference is that it only shows tickets, servers and
    contacts (net-pins) where you need to be concerned about.
    <br><br>
    Keep in mind that the server status may or may not change after you approve the work request. If there is one or
    more contact for the server they may not have approved the work yet. The approve work status will not change for
    a server until all contacts have approved the work. If you are the last one to approve the work for a server the
    server work status will change to approve and will be changed in the grid.
    <br><br>
    There are two places where you can approve the work. The first method is by clicking in the row containing the
    ticket. When the dialog box appears there is a button all "Approve All". Clicking on this button will approve this
    work on all the servers you may be supporting that are listed in the ticket. This is the fastest way to approve
    the work, but you will want to make sure you review the servers and the scheduled start times carefully before using
    this option. The second way to approve the work is to find the server in the by opening the sub grids that show the
    servers and contacts. Find your net group pin contact and click on it. When the information about your group
    appears there will be an approve button there to click on.
</p>

<br>
<h3>Main Grid</h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    <img src="help_toolbar_open_approve.php_files/a1.png">
    The following is a grid contains tickets that you need to be concerned with.
</p>

<br>
<h3>Paging Through the Grid</h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    <img src="help_toolbar_open_approve.php_files/toolbar_open2.png" align="top"><br>
    You page through the grid by clicking on the arrow icons at the bottom (center) of the grid. The first icon starting
    at the left (bar - left arrow, left arrow) will page back to the top of the grid. The second icon (left arrow,
    left arrow) takes you back one page. The third icon (right arrow, right arrow) takes you one page forward. And the
    last icon (right arrow, right arrow, bar) takes you to the last page in the grid.
</p>

<br>
<h3>Useful Grid Icons</h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    <img src="help_toolbar_open_approve.php_files/toolbar_open6.png" align="bottom"><br>
    These icons on the far bottom left of the grid can be used to <b><u>Search</u></b>, <b><u>Export to Excel</u></b> and
    <b><u>Refresh</u></b> the grid.
</p>

<br>
<h3>Search</h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    <img src="help_toolbar_open_approve.php_files/search1.png" align="bottom">
    This is what the search window looks like when you click on the magnifying glass. Once you setup your search
    criteria you would click on the Find button. You can search on multiple columns to drill down to what you want.
    When you close the search menu you can page up and down through your search results. To reset the search
    options, click on the magnifying glass icon again and click on the Reset button. You will now see all the
    default tickets again.
</p>

<br>
<h3>Export to Excel</h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    <img src="help_toolbar_open_approve.php_files/excel.png"><br>
    When you click on the suitcase icon, the entire grid will be downloaded to your PC in cvs format which is
    compatible with Excel and LibreOffice Calc. Just remember it is the whole grid and not just the data you are
    viewing in the current grid page.
</p>

<br>
<h3>Sub-Grids</h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    <img src="help_toolbar_open_approve.php_files/a2.png"><br>
    As you expand a record by clicking on the plus sign, all servers that you are requested to approve or review will
    be displayed and all servers that don't concern you are hidden. When you expand the server records, only contacts
    records where you are a member of it's net-group are shown. If the contact is from the subscriber list you will see a
    group number starting with SUBxxx where SUB tells you this is a subscriber's list. When you click on the contact
    record you will be presented with buttons that you can click on to choose how you approve the work. Please
    keep in mind the final server approval status will not change until everyone has approved the work request.
</p>


<br>
<h3>Ticket Dialog Box - General</h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    <img src="help_toolbar_open_approve.php_files/ticket1.png"><br>
    If you want to see more information about a ticket or perform some kind of action on it, click on on the row where
    the ticket is located. A dialog box will appear giving you a list of options you can perform. If you are not the
    CCT owner or CCT admin you will not be able to approve all, cancel or update the ticket. But you can look at detail
    information about the work request. However you can still log messages and send out email for the ticket.<br><br>
    If you Approve All from this dialog box, CCT will approve all the servers you support that are listed in this
    ticket. This is a handy option if the SA is targeting 100's of servers where you are a support contact for most of
    them. This will save you time from clicking on each server in the sub-grids and approving each server one by one.
    <br><br>
    The <b>Approve All - With Paging</b> button means that the on-call person for your group will be paged about work
    status so they have an opportunity to shutdown their applications, do manual restarts of their application and check
    things out to see if anything broken.<br><br>
    The <b>Approve All - NO PAGING</b> option means no pages will be sent out to your on-call net-group. In other words,
    you do not have to worry about things starting back up. You will still get an email about the work status the next
    day.<br><br>
    As you approve work for your net-group the tickets will be removed from your approve list. If you need to come back
    into CCT later and look at the ticket again, you can use the search button on the toolbar to find the ticket and
    servers you support again. From there you can add additional log information for the SA doing the work and even
    send out email messages.
</p>

<br>
<h3>Ticket Dialog Box - View Remedy Ticket</h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    <img src="help_toolbar_open_approve.php_files/ticket2.png"><br>
    Remedy tickets are no longer required in order for CCT to work. However, there is a place in the CCT ticket where
    you can enter a Remedy ticket that references this CCT ticket. There is also a View button that you click on that
    can retrieve the Remedy ticket directly from the Remedy CM database. Be patience here, because it can sometimes
    take time to retrieve and display the ticket.

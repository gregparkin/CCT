<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    Part of the process working with CCT and Remedy is that you need to attach a spreadsheet to your
    Remedy ticket to show that you have received all the required approvals to do the work for
    each server. In addition, you must show when the work is going to be started and completed
    for each server. All these server work start and end times must be in Mountain time.
    <br><br>
    The Remedy Attachment utility is a program that takes in a CCT ticket number and generates a list
    of approved work. The tool creates a CVS formatted file that can be downloaded and opened in either
    Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc.

<h3>Select CCT Ticket Number</h3>

    After clicking on the Remedy Attachment icon from the toolbar menu, the this form is displayed.
    You have two ways of telling the utility what CCT ticket you want. You can select from a list of
    available NET Group member tickets that you are a member of, if any exist, or you can type in a
    CCT ticket number that you are interested in. By default, if you type something in the text box and
    also select a ticket, the program will search for what you typed in the text box. If this is not
    what you intended then please click the Reset button and make your selection again.

    When you are ready, click the button labeled: "Click to Begin Download".

<h3>No Approved Ready Work Available</h3>

    If you mis-typed your CCT ticket number (it doesn't exist), or there is no approved ready work
    data available for the ticket, you will see this message.

<h3>CVS Formatted Download File</h3>

    In this example I have selected CCT700015055 which references CM0000327704. Notice the filename
    will include the Remedy CM ticket number to make it easier to identify it. At this point you can
    save the file to a folder on your computer or open it and then save it from either Excel or
    LibreOffice Calc.
</p>

<h3>The Spreadsheet Contents</h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    <img src="help_toolbar_remedy_attachment.php_files/remedy_attachment4.png"><br>
    This is what the contents of the spreadsheet will look like. It information is straight forward
    containing all the necessary information that you would want to attach to your Remedy ticket. (In
    this example, you would want to attach this file to Remedy ticket: CM0000327704.

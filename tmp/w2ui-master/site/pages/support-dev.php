			<h2>Prototyping</h2>
			
			<p>Any project, large or small, begins with a prototype. Though, there are many tools to create page mock-ups, it is my strong
			believe that the best tool for prototyping is HTML/CSS. It will give you:
			<ul style="margin: 15px 40px;">
				<li>A much better idea what you application will look like</li>
				<li>A glimpse into user experience (UX)</li>
				<li>A head start when you start actual development</li>
			</ul>			
			
			<p>If you need to build a prototype for your application, I will be happy to discuss it with you 
			(email address is at the bottom of the page). There is a set of principles I follow while developing JavaScript solutions:</p>
			<ul style="margin: 15px 40px;">
				<li>Clean and readable code (refactoring is good)</li>
				<li>Maintainable and extensible code (JavaScript design patterns)</li>
				<li>Adherence to web best practices</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Desktop-Like SPAs</h2>

			<p>Desktop-like single page applications is the next big thing in web development. They are particularly suited as Enterprise
			Solutions. I have put together a bundle for developing desktop-like web applications that include:</p>
			<ul style="margin: 15px 40px;">
				<li>jQuery</li>
				<li>KickStart - web framework for desktop-like spas</li>
				<li>W2UI - UI widgets</li>
				<li>Iconic fonts (icomoon) - no more image icons</li>
				<li>Chart.js or d3 - charting (optional)</li>
				<li>CodeMirror - code editing (optional)</li>
				<li>Other plugins on as needed basis</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All these libraries are JavaScript front-end solutions and there is no restriction on what server side language you can use. You can use
			Java, PHP, NodeJS, .NET or any other tool.</p>
			
			<p>Once the prototype is created, I can help you build up your own <a href="/web/support/consulting">off-shore</a> team that will finish the application and take it to 
			the production. If you would like to discuss options for your particular project, please email me.</p>

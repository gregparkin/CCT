			<h2>Consulting</h2>
			
			<p>Often, the key factor in the success of a project is the skill level and expertise of the developers who work 
			on it. I have a team of JavaScript off-shore developers that specialize in JavaScript-intensive web applications. We can either 
			extend your team by working on the front-end part of your project or provide both client and server side development 
			(NodeJS or PHP). For all of our projects we follow these guidelines:</p>
			<ul style="margin: 15px 40px;">
				<li>Weekly status meeting and reports</li>
				<li>Direct access to the off-shore developers via IM/Email</li>
				<li>Transparency in development</li>
				<li>Attention to your guidelines and instructions</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>NodeJS</h2>

			<p>NodeJS is gaining a huge momentum as an Enterprise platform and in many cases replaces traditional Java based frameworks. 
			Such large companies as PayPal, eBay, Yahoo!, WalMart and many others have already transitioned some of their services onto 
			the NodeJS stack and continue on the same path. This stack generally includes:</p>
			<ul style="margin: 15px 40px;">
				<li>NodeJS</li>
				<li>Express (Application Server)</li>
				<li>MongoDB (or MySQL/Postgres)</li>
			</ul>
			I am actively working on a NodeJS/Express based framework called KickStart that allows a faster development of NodeJS web applications.
			It is an open source framework. Because it is in active development I use a newer, more complete version that is currently available 
			to the open source community.

			<h2>LAMP</h2>

			<p>Classic LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) or LAPP (Linux, Apache, Postgres, PHP) approach is still very popular. For majority of our PHP projects
			we completely separate server and client side code. For the client side, we use W2UI and KickStart framework and for the server side we 
			use Symfony PHP Framework. The stack includes:</p>
			<ul style="margin: 15px 40px;">
				<li>Linux and Apache</li>
				<li>Symfony PHP Framework</li>
				<li>MySQL or Postgres</li>
			</ul>

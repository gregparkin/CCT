			<h2>Training</h2>
			<p>
				I live and work in Silicon Valley (more precisely in Cupertino, CA) and I am available to come and do a presentation 
				to your team about W2UI and its features. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It has been a tremendous joy for me to receive overwhelmingly positive 
				feedback from so many people who have used W2UI to create great applications. It inspires me to continue work on W2UI and
				promote it when I can.			
			</p>
			<p>
				I am also accepting invitation to come speak at meetups on the subject of JavaScript UI and front-end development in general. 
				Drop me a line and we can talk about it.
